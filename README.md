Project Brief


Problem Context


The online shopping experience for protective cases for electronic devices can be overwhelming due to the vast number of
options and lack of clear information. Customers often struggle to find products that meet their specific needs and preferences.


Goals

To create a user-friendly and visually appealing online shopping platform that simplifies the process of finding and purchasing
protective cases for electronic devices. The website aims to provide clear product information, easy navigation, and a seamless
checkout experience.


Design Inspirations


1. Technologies in the Domain:
Use of responsive web design to ensure the website is accessible on all devices, secure payment gateways for safe
transactions, and interactive product displays for better visualization.

3. Potential Technology Use:
Implementation of augmented reality features for virtual product try-on, personalized recommendations based on user
browsing history and preferences.

5. Technology Integration:
Integration with social media platforms for easy sharing of products, incorporation of live chat support for real-time
assistance and customer queries.


Assumptions ideas


• Business Assumptions:
I assume that users are seeking a streamlined shopping experience with clear and concise product information. I
plan to acquire users through targeted marketing campaigns and social media engagement. Our primary
competition includes other online retailers of protective cases, and I aim to differentiate ourselves through
superior product quality and customer service.

• User Assumptions:
I believe that our users are tech-savvy individuals looking for convenient and reliable shopping options. They value
high-quality products and appreciate a website that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.


Hypothesis Statement

I hypothesize that by providing a wide range of high-quality protective cases, coupled with a user-friendly website
design and personalized shopping experience, I will increase customer satisfaction and sales. I will measure our
success through user feedback, sales data, and key performance indicators such as conversion rates and average
order value.
